Git branches are a fundamental concept in version control. They allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on features or fixes without affecting the stable codebase. This article will guide you through the basics of Git branches and how to use them effectively.

## What are Git Branches?

In simple terms, a Git branch is a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. It represents an independent line of development. When you create a new branch, you're essentially creating a new pointer that points to the same commit as the branch you branched from.

## Key Branch Commands

Here are some essential Git commands for working with branches:

* **`git branch`**: Lists all branches in your repository. The current branch is marked with an asterisk (*).
* **`git branch <branch-name>`**: Creates a new branch with the specified name.
* **`git checkout <branch-name>`**: Switches to the specified branch.
* **`git checkout -b <branch-name>`**: Creates and switches to a new branch in a single command.
* **`git merge <branch-name>`**: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
* **`git branch -d <branch-name>`**: Deletes the specified branch (if it has been merged).
* **`git branch -D <branch-name>`**: Force deletes the specified branch (even if it hasn't been merged).

## Common Branching Workflows

### Feature Branching

Feature branching is a popular workflow where each new feature is developed in its own branch. This allows for isolated development and prevents new features from breaking the main codebase.

1. Create a new branch for the feature: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. Develop the feature on the new branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Merge the feature branch into the main branch: `git checkout main && git merge feature/new-feature`
5. Delete the feature branch: `git branch -d feature/new-feature`

### Hotfix Branching

Hotfix branching is used to quickly fix bugs in the production environment.

1. Create a hotfix branch from the production branch: `git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug main`
2. Fix the bug on the hotfix branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Merge the hotfix branch into both the production and development branches: `git checkout main && git merge hotfix/critical-bug && git checkout develop && git merge hotfix/critical-bug`
5. Delete the hotfix branch: `git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug`

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. To resolve a merge conflict:

1. Open the files with conflicts.
2. Manually resolve the conflicts by choosing the desired changes.
3. Add the resolved files: `git add <file-name>`
4. Commit the merge: `git commit`

## Conclusion

Git branches are a powerful tool for managing code changes. By understanding how to create, switch, merge, and delete branches, you can streamline your development workflow and improve collaboration.
